5,2,Lol,"I got this as a gift for my birthday and I have to say it is the best present that I’ve received. I wanted to start creating 3D objects as a hobby. It was easy to build because there were straightforward instructions and videos to follow. I managed to record my first print of a cat on TikTok Live and so many people were satisfied with the outcome.

3,2,Lol,"The shipping took a long time, the printer came in two months after I’ve ordered. The filament that shipped with the product was slightly damaged because of the tight packaging. However, the printer itself was packed perfectly. The printer is amazing, and I love using it! The filament still works but I will have to be cautious when using it.

4,1,Lol,"I have to say that this is the best tool that I own. The pricing is unbeatable, and the quality is incredible! This printer will teach you a lot that expensive printers won’t. It will take some adjustments to use it. For the size and price, it’s the best investment for beginners.

6,3,Lol,"In the beginning, my printer was working fine, and I had no major issues. After 4 months my printer started to tangle the filament in the middle of the print. I’ve tried adjusting the bed and other parts, but nothing has changed. It seems that it only works with smaller projects after some time has passed.
