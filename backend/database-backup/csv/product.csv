Create 3D projects without software or files! With a 3D Pen you can draw and create 3D doodles on any flat surface. Draw and connect material in mid-air to create unique 3D master pieces.

**Difficulty Level**: Beginner

**Perfect for**: Kids, beginners, artists, and educators

## How does a 3D pen work?

The plastic printing material is pushed through the pen, heated to the appropriate temperature, and leaves the pen in a soft, melted state. This malleable plastic hardens within a few seconds, taking the shape of your structure.

## Filament Type

ABS: Best for beginners and drawing in mid-air

PLA: Best for drawing directly onto flat surfaces
