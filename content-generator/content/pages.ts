export const _FAQsPage = "## What is 3D printing?\n\n3D printing is the process of creating three-dimensional physical objects from a computer model or digital file. The 3D printer lays down consecutive layers of the printing material until the entire object is created. 3D printing technology allows you to create any geometric shape possible!\n\nA 3D pen operates using a similar concept, but is hand-held and does not require a file, software, or computer to operate. The plastic printing material is pushed through the pen, heated to the appropriate temperature, and leaves the pen in a soft, melted state. This malleable plastic hardens within a few seconds, taking the shape of your structure.\n\n## What types of 3D printers does Free3Dm sell?\n\nFree3Dm sells Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers, Stereolithography (SLA) printers, and 3D Pens.\n\n### Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Printers\n\nFDM 3D printers work by laying down plastic filament layer by layer onto the print bed of the printer. The spool of plastic filament is stacked into the 3D printer and pushed into the printer to be warmed and melted. The melted filament is expelled from the printer’s nozzle onto the print bed. The nozzle moves in explicit directions based on the computer file it is following. The plastic fiber cools and solidifies on the print bed and another layer is placed by the printer until the print is complete.\n\nFDM printers are commonly used outside of industry manufacturing, however, they are not able to print more complex designs. This makes FDM printers great for printing basic models and simple prototypes.\n\nFree3Dm sells the Creality Ender 3, Ender 3 Pro, Ender 3 V2, and Ender 3 S1 FDM printers.\n\n### Stereolithography (SLA) Printers\n\nSLA 3D printers use lasers or UV light to harden resin into plastic. The printer creates each layer of the print in this way. Once the print is complete, it must be rinsed in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to remove any uncured resin from the surface of the print. The final product can be sanded and painted for a clean finish.\n\nSLA printers are great for printing high-resolution and extremely accurate prints with fine details. SLA printers are also great for printing functional prototypes, patterns, and tools.\n\nFree3Dm sells the ELEG00 Mars 2 Mono, Mars 3 MSLA, and Saturn S Mono SLA printers.\n\n### 3D Pens\n\n3D Pens are hand-held, miniature 3D printers that allow you to create 3D prints in mid-air or on any flat surface, in seconds.\n\n3D Pens can print with both ABS and PLA filaments. The filament is pushed through the pen, heated to the appropriate temperature, and leaves the pen in a soft, melted state. This malleable plastic hardens within a few seconds, taking the shape of your structure.\n\n## What types of material can 3D printers print with?\n\nRoutine preventative maintenance for any 3D printer is very important for extending the life of the printer. Postponing routine maintenance may result in performance and safety issues. The more frequently the printer is used, the more often maintenance checks should be performed. FDM and SLA printers require different types of routine maintenance.\n\n## How do I maintain my 3D printer?\n\nRoutine preventative maintenance for any 3D printer is very important for extending the life of the printer. Postponing routine maintenance may result in performance and safety issues. The more frequently the printer is used, the more often maintenance checks should be performed. FDM and SLA printers require different types of routine maintenance.\n\n### FDM Printer Maintenance\n\n - Routinely dust and clean the outside of the printer and printer bed\n - Inspect printer for wear and tear, and re-tighten any loose screws\n - Apply lubricant to linear rods and ball bearings (Free3Dm recommends [Super Lube](https://www.super-lube.com/multi-purpose-synthetic-oil-with-syncolon-ptfe-51004))\n - Adjust and tighten rubber timing belts\n - Routinely clean the printer nozzle with a wire brush\n\n### SLA Printer Maintenance\n\n - Inspect mirrors and the projector lens for dust or smudges, clean\n   with a damp microfiber cloth or compressed air duster\n - Clean the print bed with a cloth between prints\n\n## How long will it take to get my order?\n\nFree3Dm ships products internationally, using different courier services such as FedEx, UPS, Canada Post, and International Cargo Services to get your order to you as soon as possible.\n\nThe amount of time it takes to receive your order depends on location and courier service.\n\nOnce your order is placed, processed, and shipped you will automatically be provided with a tracking number. You will receive an email from Free3Dm confirming your tracking number and order details, for your records.\n\nIf your shipment is late or lost, see Free3Dm’s Shipping & Delivery policy.\n\n## What are the shipping rates?\n\nShipping rates are calculated automatically at checkout and will depend on location and courier service.\n\nSee Free3Dm’s Shipping & Delivery policy for more information.\n\n## Where is my order?\n\nOnce your order is placed, processed, and shipped you will automatically be provided with a tracking number. You will receive an email from Free3Dm confirming your tracking number and order details, for your records.\n\nIf your shipment is late or lost, see Free3Dm’s Shipping & Delivery policy.\n\n## What do I do if my 3D printer is faulty?\n\nFree3Dm warranties all printers, printer products, and printer materials for the first 30 days from the date of purchase on the Free3Dm website.

export const _GettingStartedGuidePage = "# Getting Started with 3D Printing\nWhat this guide covers:\n\n - What is 3D printing?\n - How does 3D printing work?\n - What do you need for 3D printing?\n - What can you make with 3D printing?\n - More recommended products for starting out\n\n## What is 3D printing?\n3D printing uses three-dimensional digital models to create a physical object.\n\n3D printing is also called additive manufacturing since it adds material to create an object---like creating intricate designs with icing on a cake. This contrasts with traditional manufacturing, which starts with a solid block and removes material to create an object---like carving a statue from a block of marble.\n## How does 3D printing work?\nBefore printing, you must prepare the 3D digital model with 3D slicer software. 3D slicer software slices the model of the object you want to print into tiny layers. Most 3D printers come with 3D slicer software---our Creality and ELEGOO printers all come with slicer software.\n\nWhen your 3D printer creates an object, it prints each layer in the 3D model one by one.\n\nThe two most popular types of 3D printers are FDM and SLA printers, which print objects in different ways.\n\nOur starter printer, <u>the Creality Ender 3</u>, is an **FDM printer**, which stands for Fused Deposition Modeling. FDM printers use a spool of plastic filament that is heated, melted, and pushed through a nozzle to print your object layer by layer.\n\n**SLA printers** (Stereolithography printers) create objects from liquid resin by hardening each layer with a UV light. SLA printers have a vat of resin that rests above an LCD panel. Each layer of the object is displayed on the LCD panel, which directs the UV light to cure the resin in the exact pattern of each layer.\n## What do you need for 3D printing?\n<u>Our starter kit</u> includes everything you need to start 3D printing your own projects. It includes:\n\n - Creality Ender 3 3D printer\n - 1.75mm PLA Filament - White\n - 1.75mm PLA Filament - Black\n - 1.75mm PLA Filament - Red\n - 1.75mm PLA Filament - Blue\n### You need a printer\nThe Creality Ender 3 3D printer comes with all the necessary parts, including:\n - a **print bed**, which is the platform surface onto which objects are printed\n - a **Bowden extruder**, which pushes the printing material through the nozzle\n - a **nozzle**, which pushes out the melted material to create the layers of your object\n\nYou don’t need additional parts to get started with 3D printing, but you may want to try out different parts as you try out new projects. See our <u>Accessories</u> page to explore the variety of parts available for 3D printers.\n### You need filament\nThe Creality Ender 3 3D printer uses filament to print, which is a plastic thread that comes in spools. Filaments come in a variety of materials. Our starter kit comes with PLA (Polyactic acid) filaments in a variety of colours. PLA filaments are one of the most popular types of 3D printing filaments because they have a low printing temperature and no off-putting odour.\n\nYou should store your filaments in air-tight plastic bags or containers to keep them dry for the best printing performance. We recommend using our air-tight storage boxes---you can find these on our <u>Accessories</u> page.\n## What can you make with 3D printing?\n\n\n![Cut-out cookie shapes on a wooden table beside cookie cutters](https://images.pexels.com/photos/5471934/pexels-photo-5471934.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=pexels-olia-danilevich-5471934.jpg&fm=jpg&_gl=1*194iod9*_ga*MTE4NjM5ODg3My4xNjY0ODM1NTAy*_ga_8JE65Q40S6*MTY2NzE1OTYwNi42LjEuMTY2NzE1OTc1OC4wLjAuMA..)\nYou can make anything that you can imagine! You can make:\n\n - crafty projects, like vases and cookie cutters\n - practical projects, like replacement parts and tool parts\n - fun projects, like board game pieces and figurines\n\nOr make your own 3D models!\n\nWe like websites like [Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/) that offer 3D models for any type of 3D printing project.\n## More recommended products for starting out\nCheck out our range of <u>filament printers here</u>.\nCheck out our range of <u>filament colours here</u>.\nCheck out our <u>fun 3D pens here</u>.";
