The shipping took a long time, the printer came in two months after Iâ€™ve ordered. The filament that shipped with the product was slightly damaged because of the tight packaging. However, the printer itself was packed perfectly. The printer is amazing, and I love using it! The filament still works but I will have to be cautious when using it.
