The extruder head had a crooked connector. It interrupted the installation and the attachment of the head to the metal support (x axis). I had to bend it back carefully. There was a risk of cracking the two small connectors. These are the most important pats of the printer. If I couldn’t fix it, then I would’ve been really upset. Other than this personal issue, the printer is pretty good. I hope no one else had the same issue.
