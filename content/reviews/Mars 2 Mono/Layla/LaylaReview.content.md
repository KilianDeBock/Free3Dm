I was very intimidating intimidated by this printer when I got it. I’m very serious about safety so I did all my research before starting anything. After I finished researching and had everything ready, I started using the printer. Once I started using it often all my worries went away and now, I am just having fun. I’ve already printed 13 different miniatures. I plan on making so many more in the future.
