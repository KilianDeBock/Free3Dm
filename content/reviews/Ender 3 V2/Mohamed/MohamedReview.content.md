The package arrived in great shape with all the parts and tools needed to create the printer. There was an extra screw of each size in the package. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The best way is to pay close attention to the diagrams/photos. There were sample files on the memory card, and I was able to print the dog and 3 other small objects with the sample filament. I love my new printer!
