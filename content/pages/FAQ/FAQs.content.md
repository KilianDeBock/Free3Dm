## What is 3D printing?

3D printing is _the process of creating_ three-dimensional physical objects from a computer model or digital file. The 3D printer lays down consecutive layers of the printing material until the entire object is created. 3D printing technology allows you to create any geometric shape possible!

A 3D pen operates using a similar concept, but is hand-held and does not require a file, software, or computer to operate. The plastic printing material is pushed through the pen, heated to the appropriate temperature, and leaves the pen in a soft, melted state. This malleable plastic hardens within a few seconds, taking the shape of your structure.

## What types of 3D printers does Free3Dm sell?

Free3Dm sells Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers, Stereolithography (SLA) printers, and 3D Pens.

### Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Printers

FDM 3D printers work by laying down plastic filament layer by layer onto the print bed of the printer. The spool of plastic filament is stacked into the 3D printer and pushed into the printer to be warmed and melted. The melted filament is expelled from the printer’s nozzle onto the print bed. The nozzle moves in explicit directions based on the computer file it is following. The plastic fiber cools and solidifies on the print bed and another layer is placed by the printer until the print is complete.

FDM printers are commonly used outside of industry manufacturing, however, they are not able to print more complex designs. This makes FDM printers great for printing basic models and simple prototypes.

Free3Dm sells the Creality Ender 3, Ender 3 Pro, Ender 3 V2, and Ender 3 S1 FDM printers.

### Stereolithography (SLA) Printers

SLA 3D printers use lasers or UV light to harden resin into plastic. The printer creates each layer of the print in this way. Once the print is complete, it must be rinsed in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to remove any uncured resin from the surface of the print. The final product can be sanded and painted for a clean finish.

SLA printers are great for printing high-resolution and extremely accurate prints with fine details. SLA printers are also great for printing functional prototypes, patterns, and tools.

Free3Dm sells the ELEG00 Mars 2 Mono, Mars 3 MSLA, and Saturn S Mono SLA printers.

### 3D Pens

3D Pens are hand-held, miniature 3D printers that allow you to create 3D prints in mid-air or on any flat surface, in seconds.

3D Pens can print with both ABS and PLA filaments. The filament is pushed through the pen, heated to the appropriate temperature, and leaves the pen in a soft, melted state. This malleable plastic hardens within a few seconds, taking the shape of your structure.

## What types of material can 3D printers print with?

Routine preventative maintenance for any 3D printer is very important for extending the life of the printer. Postponing routine maintenance may result in performance and safety issues. The more frequently the printer is used, the more often maintenance checks should be performed. FDM and SLA printers require different types of routine maintenance.

## How do I maintain my 3D printer?

Routine preventative maintenance for any 3D printer is very important for extending the life of the printer. Postponing routine maintenance may result in performance and safety issues. The more frequently the printer is used, the more often maintenance checks should be performed. FDM and SLA printers require different types of routine maintenance.

### FDM Printer Maintenance

 - Routinely dust and clean the outside of the printer and printer bed
 - Inspect printer for wear and tear, and re-tighten any loose screws
 - Apply lubricant to linear rods and ball bearings (Free3Dm recommends [Super Lube](https://www.super-lube.com/multi-purpose-synthetic-oil-with-syncolon-ptfe-51004))
 - Adjust and tighten rubber timing belts
 - Routinely clean the printer nozzle with a wire brush

### SLA Printer Maintenance

 - Inspect mirrors and the projector lens for dust or smudges, clean
   with a damp microfiber cloth or compressed air duster
 - Clean the print bed with a cloth between prints
