## What is 3D printing?
3D printing uses three-dimensional digital models to create a physical object.

3D printing is also called additive manufacturing since it adds material to create an object---like creating intricate designs with icing on a cake. This contrasts with traditional manufacturing, which starts with a solid block and removes material to create an object---like carving a statue from a block of marble.
## How does 3D printing work?
Before printing, you must prepare the 3D digital model with 3D slicer software. 3D slicer software slices the model of the object you want to print into tiny layers. Most 3D printers come with 3D slicer software---our Creality and ELEGOO printers all come with slicer software.

When your 3D printer creates an object, it prints each layer in the 3D model one by one.

The two most popular types of 3D printers are **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)** and **Stereolithography (SLA)** printers, which print objects in different ways.

**FDM printers** use a spool of plastic filament that is heated, melted, and pushed through a nozzle to print your object layer by layer. Our starter printer, [the Creality Ender 3](/category/printers/ender-3), is an FDM printer. 

**SLA printers** create objects from liquid resin by hardening each layer with a UV light. SLA printers have a vat of resin that rests above an LCD panel. Each layer of the object is displayed on the LCD panel, which directs the UV light to cure the resin in the exact pattern of each layer.
## What do you need for 3D printing?
If you're new to 3D printing, we recommend starting with filament and an FDM printer. Printing with filament is easier than resin because it's easier to set up and doesn't require post-processing. Filament is also sturdier and less expensive than resin.
### You need a printer
Our starter FDM printer, [the Creality Ender 3](/category/printers/ender-3), is a great printer for beginners. It comes with all the necessary parts, including:
 - a **print bed**, which is the platform surface onto which objects are printed
 - a **Bowden extruder**, which pushes the printing material through the nozzle
 - a **nozzle**, which pushes out the melted material to create the layers of your object

You don’t need additional parts to get started with 3D printing, but you may want to try out different parts as you try out new projects. See our [Accessories](/category/accessories) page to explore the variety of parts available for 3D printers.
### You need filament
The Creality Ender 3 3D printer uses filament to print, which is a plastic thread that comes in spools. Filaments come in a variety of materials. PLA filaments are one of the most popular types of 3D printing filaments because they have a low printing temperature and no off-putting odour.

## What can you make with 3D printing?

You can make anything that you can imagine! You can make:

 - crafty projects, like vases and cookie cutters
 - practical projects, like replacement parts and tool parts
 - fun projects, like board game pieces and figurines

Or make your own 3D models!

We like websites like [Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/) that offer 3D models for any type of 3D printing project.
