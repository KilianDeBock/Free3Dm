At Free3Dm, we strive to provide the best 3D printers, filaments, and accessories to our customers. We also understand how important it is that our products remain sustainable and friendly to the environment.

## Reduce CO2 Emissions

3D printing technology is at the forefront of sustainable manufacturing. 3D printing allows products to easily be created and packaged locally, removing the need for products to be transported multiple times and for excess fuel to be burned in the process. Manufacturing with 3D printing technology causes an immense reduction in transportation costs and emissions. This is an amazing indirect benefit to 3D printing!

## Reduce Production Waste

3D printing reduces the amount of waste created in the production and manufacturing process. 3D printing uses the exact amount of material required to create the product because it builds the product layer by layer. This is a huge difference from other forms of manufacturing that create material waste through milling or laser cutting.

## Use Environmentally Friendly Materials

PLA plastic is a great material to use in 3D printing because it is easy to use, doesn’t emit harsh odors or fumes, and is more environmentally friendly compared to ABS filaments. PLA filaments are created from renewable and natural materials such as corn. PLA can be biologically degraded within a few days in industrial composting conditions.

## Recycle!

As with all plastic production, it is important to recycle and reuse. At Free3Dm, we encourage our customers to do their part in reducing the amount of plastic waste produced, reusing plastic products, and recycling products at the appropriate local recycling facilities.
